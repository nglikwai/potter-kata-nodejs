# Potter Kata

This project is a solution to the **Potter Kata** problem by Nick

## Algorithm

When designing the discount application solution, both the **Greedy algorithm** and **Backtracking** approaches were evaluated. **Backtracking** is effective for exploring all possible combinations to find the optimal solution, but it can lead to large stack sizes and increased complexity.

On the other hand, the **Greedy algorithm** offers better performance for larger datasets, providing results that are close to optimal with significantly improved efficiency.

## Run the code

Pass an array of numbers to the function, where each number k represents a book. The value of k should be between 1 and 5, inclusive. For example, a valid input look like [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5].
